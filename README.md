In this work, we investigate the market-making problem on a trading session in which a continuous phase on a limit order book is followed by a closing auction. Whereas standard optimal market-making models typically rely on terminal inventory penalties to manage end-of-day risk, ignoring the significant liquidity events available in closing auctions, we propose a Deep Q-Learning framework that explicitly incorporates this mechanism. We introduce a market-making framework designed to explicitly anticipate the closing auction, continuously refining the projected clearing price as the trading session evolves. We develop a generative stochastic market model to simulate the trading session and to emulate the market. Our theoretical model and Deep Q-Learning method is applied on the generator in two settings: (1) when the mid price follows a rough Heston model with generative data from this stochastic model; and (2) when the mid price corresponds to historical data of assets from the S&P 500 index and the performance of our algorithm is compared with classical benchmarks from optimal market making.

Both active numerical settings use a one-minute physical clock: a 120-minute
CLOB phase followed by a 30-minute closing auction. Synthetic rough-Heston time
is converted from minutes to trading years with 98,280 trading minutes/year.
They also use one shared market simulator, action space, reward, and learning
configuration. The sole economic setting difference is the exogenous mid-price:
rough Heston versus verified SIP bid/ask midquotes. The shared CLOB calibration
is `lambda0=1`, `V_inf=2`, `rho_lob=0.96`, and `L_max=200`; the enabled DQN
auction grid has 254 local-indicative templates with conditional cancellation.
